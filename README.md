<h1>AOC 2022 in pure C</h1>

I'm trying to solve https://adventofcode.com/2022 in C. 
Actually, all the files that I have pushed to this repository worked to solve my AOC.
I have to admit that there in some exercices there is a lot of repeated code. I know that I can clean it up, but it's an unnecesary waste of time, because the problems are already solved. Also I need to say that I couldn't take AOC challenges up to date because of studies and other reasons.

<h2>For reasons of study I abandoned the challenge</h2>
